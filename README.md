# Project Euler Solutions (ongoing)
This repository is a collection of my own solutions to Project Euler. The solutions are written in Java and Python. 

Detailed explanation on the approaches of solving these problems will be provided, but for now the explanations are inside the source code.

The list of problems can be found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives
